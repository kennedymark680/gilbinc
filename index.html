  <h1>Gilbert and Associates</h1>
  <h2>Consulting Highlights</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Created the framework for a coastal surveillance system for Taiwan and wrote procurement documents for it.</li>
      <li>In 1991, engaged by the American Mobile Satellite Corporation; they are still a client now as Ligado after several name changes; they were a start up then and since have placed three satellites in operation. I had done my masters thesis on satellite telecommunications: assisted them with maritime issues and created their roll out for state and local governments plus emergency telecommunication support for organizations such as the Red Cross. They are still providing this while seeking regulator approval for a combined satellite/terrestrial system. Assisted with them in winning $90M auction for spectrum to establish XM Satellite Radio, which has now merged to form Sirius-XM Radio. Led ultimately successful efforts at the IMO to enable regulatory approval for alternatives to Inmarsat as the satellite provider for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.</li>
      <li>Assisted Lockheed Martin in Syracuse in winning:</li>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>A nationwide Ports And Waterways Safety System (PAWSS)</li>
            <li>An initial $50 M contract with Egypt for vessel traffic systems for the Suez Canal and portions of the Mediterranean. It was expanded with another $50 M to provide response vessels and operations centers. Did on site work in Egypt during three visits.</li>
            <li>A similar system for Greece plus for the Bosporus, Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Supported Casa Aircraft, now part of Airbus in winning more than $800 M as part of the Deepwater Program.</li>
      <li>Consulted with Lockheed Martin Moorestown to win the Coast Guard’s Deepwater Program, which has led to recapitalization programs for most of the Coast Guard’s operational assets. Engaged many Coast Guard subject matter experts via subcontracts to assist in strategy development, formulating solutions and other senior level experts to review their work. Assisted in identifying and vetting major team members. Provided background information and material to assist lobbyists in their work.</li>
      <li>Supported the design of a port in Madagascar that was constructed to export high value minerals.</li>
      <li>Assisting a company seeking a multi-year $900 M contract for worldwide managed IT services and another providing global high precision ocean and land tracking services.</li>
      <li>Served pro bono as a board member for:</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>The Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM); in addition to regular board work, I create and run technical programs for annual assemblies of more than 20 presentations. During the last few years, we have added sessions on cyber security followed by a workshop that has produced significant useful results. We have a similar program for autonomous vehicles which are called Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) by the IMO. This program couples our standards work with autonomous land and water vehicle programs based on our standards that provide sub-millimeter accuracy with a telecommunications layer and another to ensure integrity of their products.</li>
          <li>Recently we at RTCM organized and ran the e-Navigation North America Conference, which is a companion to others in Europe and Asia. These are assisting the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) in its efforts to implement the IMO’s e-Navigation Program. It was created because of disappointment that very significant advances in electronic navigations systems were not producing corresponding improvements in safety.</li>
          <li>The Coast Guard Foundation that raises money to support Coast Guard members; my wife and I created and ran for 20 years with lots of help from an organizing committee and the Army Navy Country Club a scholarship golf tournament. It has raised several million dollars for a program at the Foundation to support junior level Coast Guard members and their dependents seeking to further their educational goals. This initial effort provided several million dollars to launch the program, which is now attracting additional funds so that this year all qualified applicants seeking funds were accommodated.</li>
